\chapter{Simulation studies}

We might imagine that, with the theory that describes the relevant physics in place, we are now able to simply calculate a theoretical prediction for the distributions of photons that we can expect to see. Unfortunately, the integrals involved do not have analytical solutions. In stead, we will use the Monte Carlo method for numerical integration to generate some output from our theoretical model. The Monte Carlo method functions by picking for each variable that is integrated over, a random value from a suitable distribution of initial values, and evaluating the expression being integrated for those values. Repeating this calculaiton enough times, and we expect to get a picture of the behaviour of the expression being integrated over the whole range of possible values of the integrated variables. The very large number of random numbers required apparently led those people who named the method to think of the very large number of dice being rolled on the gambling tables in Monte Carlo.

Since all of the variables that we integrate over have physical significance, we might also view choosing specific values for these variables as laying out the kinematics of a single hypothetical event. For this reason, the software designed to perform the Monte Carlo integration is known in particle physics as event generators.

\section{Event generators}

The event generator used for the bulk of the work in this thesis is CalcHEP \cite{calchep}, a tool choses for its familiarity to the author, and its compatibility with the Feynman rule creation software LanHEP, which will be discussed later in this chapter. Other choices of event generators include MadGraph \cite{madgraph5} and pythia \cite{pythia}. To illustrate the behaviour of these different generators with respect to one another, figure~\ref{evgen} plots distributions of invariant mass ($M_{\gamma\gamma}$) and transverse momentum ($p_T$).

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The default running of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_S$ differs in CalcHEP from the running used in pythia and MadGraph. To achieve the result in figure~\ref{evgen}, the default was changed to 
\[Q=\sqrt{\frac{p_T(\gamma_1)^2+p_T(\gamma_2)^2}{2}},\]
which matches the setting in the other two generators.

\section{Feynman rule calculators}
Introducing the new interaction into these event generators, which are built by their designers to produce Standard Model events, requires that we describe the new term in a way that the event generators can understand. Here, we will use the tool LanHEP \cite{lanhep}, which converts a Lagrangian written in a form close to \latex mathematical notation into its corresponding Feynman rules, written in a format that CalcHEP's progenitor program CompHEP uses, and which CalcHEP accepts as well.

"surrounding state" radiation this is where pythia comes in in force.
