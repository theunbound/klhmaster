\chapter{Analysis}
All of the bits so far are put together, and a limit on the size of
$\Lambda$ is found.

In chapter~\ref{ch.mc}, we produced, among others, a sample of Monte Carlo events that gives the SM prediction for the distribution of events. Since we discovered above, that the \atlas{} $\gamma\gamma$ Monte Carlo sample gives a distribution of events that matches data well, we will compare these two samples to asses how well our SM prediction matches data. In doing so, we encounter a few problems.

First, it appears that the procedure which should correct for pileup in the detector simulation procedure has not functioned as intended


. The \atlas{} Monte Carlo set, which we found above reproduces the distribution of events in data well, also includes the process described by the box diagram, shown in fig.~\ref{hiorder}. So to compare the MC set from chapter~\ref{ch.mc} with the \atlas{} MC set, and with data, we must know the contribution from the box diagram.
