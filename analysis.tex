\chapter{Analysis}
All of the bits so far are put together, and a limit on the size of
$\Lambda$ is found.

In chapter~\ref{ch.mc}, we produced, among others, a sample of Monte Carlo events that gives the SM prediction for the distribution of events. Since we discovered above, that the \atlas{} $\gamma\gamma$ Monte Carlo sample gives a distribution of events that matches data well, we will compare these two samples to asses how well our SM prediction matches data. In doing so, we encounter a few problems.

First, it appears that the procedure which should correct for pileup in the detector simulation procedure has not functioned as intended. During detector simulation, the events produced for this thesis are assigned only a very limited range of values for the number of interactions per bunch crossing. Pileup reweighting produces a weight for each event so that its distribution in a Monte Carlo dataset mathches the distribution found in data.

Since this appears to be a technical glitch, we will substitute a reweighting in the number of reconstructed primary vertices---vertices considered to originate directly from interactions between protons---in each event. The distribution of numbers of primary vertices in the present MC data set is compared to the one found in the \atlas{} MC set in figure~\ref{pvnnone}.

\end{figure}

[Uncertainty...] [Also, effect on Mgg...?]

The second issue we encounter is in the distribution of $E_T^\text{iso}$, which is much broader in the CalcHEP MC set than in the \atlas{} one, as illustrated in figure~\ref{etpv}. Assuming that the distribution in the CalcHEP sample is just the one in the \atlas{} sample, but broadened, we develop a mapping function to reverse that effect. The result of applying this function is shown in fig.~\ref{etmap}.

\begin{figure}[htp]

\end{figure}

These distributions are now very close to being identical. We correct the remaining discrepancy by reweighting the CalcHEP sample [uncertainty, effect on Mgg...?]

Finally, the CalcHEP sample only included events produced by the tree level process, whereas the \atlas{} sample also includes the contribution from the box diagram shown in fig.~\ref{hiorder}. So, to meaningfully compare the two, we must know the contribution from the box diagram.

[something something, fig.~\ref{boxmgg} runs out of statistics at 1\,000 GeV, something something, extrapolate by fit. Reference to function.]

. The \atlas{} Monte Carlo set, which we found above reproduces the distribution of events in data well, also includes the process described by the box diagram, shown in fig.~\ref{hiorder}. So to compare the MC set from chapter~\ref{ch.mc} with the \atlas{} MC set, and with data, we must know the contribution from the box diagram.
