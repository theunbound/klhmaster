\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis, we attempted to estimate the effect of a $qq\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ contact interaction, with associated energy scale $\Lambda$, upon the distribution of $M_{\gamma\gamma}$ in diphoton events produced in proton--proton collisions at the LHC.

The new interaction was introduced in a modified Standard Model through the effective Lagrangian approach.

This is a highly non--trivial endeavour, as there are no suitable \atlas{} Monte Carlo sets on which to base this attempt. We found that even the Monte Carlo set created to simulate the Standard Model $qq\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ process did not satisfactorily cover the sensitive region at high invariant masses. Thus, we were required to go through every step needed to create a suitable MC data set. This process involved long processing times, using large and cumbersome software packages. In the end, there is room for improvement in the outcome of this process.

We exploited the quadratic form of the expression for the strength of the new interaction to derive a shape for the distribution of events at arbitrary $\Lambda$ from distributions created at two discrete values of $\Lambda$ and the Standard Model distribution. This involved describing the shape of the distribution by performing a simultaneous fit over all three distributions.

A data driven background estimation technique was applied to data taken from the \atlas{} detector at the LHC. The resulting estimated background distribution was combined with appropriate distributions from Monte Carlo, and its shape was extrapolated into the sensitive invaraint mass region above 1\,000 GeV.

A most likely value of $\Lambda$, with accompanying confidence interval was found by comparing the data distribution of invariant mass, $M_{\gamma\gamma}$, with the Monte Carlo distribution, combined with appropriate backgrounds, using a maximum profile likelihood procedure, which took systematic uncertainties into account. The invariant mass was chose as the discriminating variable among several other variables, for its discriminating power and robustness.

The results are:awful

In addition to the previously mentioned issues with the Monte Carlo samples, the resolution of which would require repeating a significant chunk of the work done to produce these samples, there are several ways in which the determination of uncertainties may be improved. Tools exist, which can provide better estimates of uncertainties due to detector effects, for instance, although these would need to be incorporated into the procedure for creating the original Monte Carlo sets.

Lastly, an analysis similar to this one on the data from 13 TeV collisions being taken at the LHC this year (2015) would of course have substantially better sensitivity due to the strong enhancement with energy.
